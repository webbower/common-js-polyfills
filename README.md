# Common JS polyfills

A collection of JS polyfills for modern APIs. Build them into your project as needed. They are broken into logical chunks to be included a la carte.

__This is currently Alpha. The polyfills are currently untested. Make sure to test your code rather than assume in browsers that need polyfilling.__

These are meant to support back to IE8. If you need support for IE7, some of these polyfills may not be helpful.

## Todo

* Add unit tests
* Linting
* Consistent coding style

## Polyfills to add

* `Element.prototype.dataset`
* `Element.prototype.previousElementSibling`
* `Element.prototype.nextElementSibling`
